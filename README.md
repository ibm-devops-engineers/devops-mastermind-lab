## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Here's the proposed clean structure for better navigation and scalability:

```

├── 📂 profiles/          # Students' intro PRs with profile and first script
├── 📂 scripts/           # Bash, Python, and automation scripts
├── 📂 docker/            # Dockerfiles and containerization templates
├── 📂 kubernetes/        # Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
├── 📂 terraform/         # Infrastructure as Code modules
├── 📂 cicd-pipelines/    # GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and other CI/CD pipelines
└── README.md             # This file

```

## First-week goal (Session 3: Git basics)


**Task for every student (first contribution):** Add `introductions/<github-username>.md` that includes:
- Name, batch, LinkedIn/GitHub link
- One short Git tip you use
- A tiny file: a one-line shell script, a `.gitignore` example, or a one-file Dockerfile


This forces everyone to: fork → branch → commit → open PR → respond to review.

## How we'll run this (high level)


1. Weekly challenges tied to course modules.
2. Every PR must follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` and pass the CI checks.
3. Maintainers (rotate) approve and merge good PRs.
4. GitHub Actions update a live `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and the leaderboard.
