# Contributing — DevOps Mastermind Lab


Thanks for helping build this lab. We kept the process simple so everyone (including absolute beginners) can contribute.


## Quick flow
1. Fork (if you don't have write access).
2. Create a branch: `feat/short-descriptor` (e.g. `feat/intro-ali`).
3. Make a **small** change — for the first two weeks keep PRs to **one file**.
4. Push your branch and open a PR. Label it `good-first-issue`.
5. Ask for a review from the `@maintainers` team.


## Commit message style
Use short conventional-style messages, for example:
feat(intro): add intro for @ fix(docs): update setup instructions



## PR checklist (required for first-week PRs)
- [ ] Only one file changed
- [ ] Template followed
- [ ] No secrets or credentials
- [ ] Short PR description


If you need help at any step — open an issue and tag `@maintainers`.
